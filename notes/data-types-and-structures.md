#### A few Questions
 - Difference b/w Primitive types and non-primitive types ?
 - Difference b/w data types and data structures ?
 - Language(Python) specific Data Structures and Abstract Data Types ?
 - Explore implementation of trees by list of lists approach vs regular approach ie node and a tree class.

#### Notes (in no particular order or category)
- Classes are analogous to abstract data types because a user of a class only sees the state and behavior of
a data item. [source](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Introduction/GettingStartedwithData.html)
