- Classes are analogous to abstract data types because a user of a class only sees the state and behavior of
a data item. [source](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Introduction/GettingStartedwithData.html)  
- The advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).[source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#ranges)
